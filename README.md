## Google refresh token generator
So, I made this refresh token generator in my way to acomplish another project. If you need it, use it!


# Requirements
You need to create a google application with its respective client id and replace it in a .env file inside the project.
(I could make an explanation about this later.)

Next, you just have to run ```npm install & node .```

And then get logged in the browser.
